#This is a sample customization file for DAVILA, based on the schema for Project Quincy (also included)
#It is a pipe ("|") separated CSV file
#You can either change the information below or replace this file with one of your own making

#If you replace the file, make sure the new file is called "customize.csv" and placed in the data folder of your Processing sketch, or follow the instructions
#in README.TXT to use another name/location

#If you create the file as a spreadsheet and then export to PIPE SEPARATED CSV
#make sure you remove any quotation marks or unnecessary spaces from the csv file, they will confuse the parser!


#These lines set the metadata for your diagram, the information will display in the top left corner, in bold

#This next group of lines allows you to color code your modules and indicate which entity is the central node of that module
#The central node allows you to choose whether to display all the entities in the module, or just the central entity and module name to save space
#If you don't want to indicate a central module, make sure there is "|" immediately after the hex color, otherwise the parser will throw an 
#Array Out of Bounds exception
#Probably best to limit your diagram to 5 or 6 modules, otherwise it can get confusing

assignment_titles|postings|A list of all the different assignments held by individuals. 
assignment_types|postings|Groups the possible assignments for ease of searching.

in_regions|places|Allows locations to be included in multiple regions at once.
in_states|places|Allows locations to be included in multiple states over time.
individuals|biographical|Records basic information about a specific person, including a standardized name for authority work and the state they are most associated with.
letters|correspondence|Metadata about a letter: sender and recipient (individual or group), location to and from, dates (sent, received, archived).  The database does not store text or images of letters.

users|footnotes|All the registered users in the database.  This table can be expanded to support many authentication strategies.
validations|footnotes|Validations is a table unlike any other in the database; it does not directly link to any of the records in the database.  Instead, it records the type of validatable entity (model name) and that entity's unique identifier.  This way, the validations table can "link" to as many (or as few) tables in the database as you require.  The validations also table records the user who entered the data, and the source from which the data is validated.  The "supports" field will record whether a given citation supports on contradicts the data in question.
